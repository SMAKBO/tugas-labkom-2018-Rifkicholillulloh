<p> <span style="color:purple">

Menthol has been used to help treat a wide variety of gastrointestinal ailments. For example, menthol can prevent or treat gas and bloating, making it a potential assistive treatment for irritable bowel syndrome, indigestion and colic, says the University of Michigan Health System. Menthol can also be applied topically to help to relieve itching and inflammation due to contact dermatitis and hives. Topical menthol also helps to relieve headaches, states the University of Maryland Medical Center. Additionally, people have taken menthol orally to treat asthma, bronchitis, colds, flu and other respiratory ailments. No widely-accepted, conclusive scientific evidence supports the use of menthol in treating any medical condition, however. </span> </p>

<P> <span style="color:purple"> 

Menthol can be taken in different ways. Extracted menthol can be used or you can take it directly in the form of peppermint or eucalyptus. For pain and inflammation, it’s best to apply menthol topically in a form of cream, ointment, or skin patch.

You might also want to apply peppermint, eucalyptus, or pennyroyal oils to the affected skin areas for anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects. In achieving the preferred effect, ointment, cream, skin patch should contain at least 1 to 16 percent menthol. In treating gastrointestinal ailments, you can take menthol in the form of peppermint tea, tincture, or capsule. 1 teaspoon of dried peppermint leaves in a cup of boiling water for 7-10 minutes. Drink 3-4 cups daily.

However, it’s best to ask for a physician’s advice before using menthol</span></P>

<P> <span style="color:purple"> Taking peppermint oil capsules containing menthol effectively treated pain from intestinal spasms in double-blind clinical trials, according to a 1997 issue of the "Journal of Gastroenterology" and a 1984 issue of the "British Journal of Clinical Practice." A 1994 study in "Cephalalgia" found that applying peppermint oil to your forehead or temples may relieve tension headaches, says the University of Michigan Health System. The menthol in peppermint oil effectively treated symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome in a 2007 double-blind clinical trial published in the journal "Digestive and Liver Disease." Another double-blind trial reported in "Digestion" in 2004 discovered that menthol-containing herbal remedies helped in treating indigestion, notes the University of Maryland Medical Center. Finally, a study found that peppermint oil containing menthol had antispasmodic actions on the intestines during endoscopic bowel procedures, according to a 2006 issue of the "Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology."</span></P>
