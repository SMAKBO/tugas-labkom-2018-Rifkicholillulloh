	<p>Some people think that the cooling sensation from menthol is caused by mechanical damage by menthol crystals or by evaporation (like when you touch rubbing alcohol), but this is not the case. The cooling is an interaction on the molecular level with our calcium channels. Receptors that are responsible for feeling cold are triggered by menthol's effects on calcium channels and a cooling sensation occurs. There are calcium channels in cell walls throughout our bodies, and that is why we can see systemic toxicity after swallowing or inhaling concentrated amounts of menthol. <strong>Serious effects include seizures, coma, and death.</strong></p>

	<p>Menthol can <strong>cause eye and skin irritation </strong>. When used on the skin, menthol is typically diluted into a "carrier oil", lotion, or other vehicle. If a high-percentage menthol product is applied to the skin, irritation and even chemical burns have been reported. There are a few reports of people being very sensitive to menthol and having severe skin reactions to even small amounts.</p>

	<p>Products that contain menthol are <strong> flammable </strong>. In 2000, the FDA added a warning against putting products with menthol near a flame, in hot water, or in a microwave oven. There is additional warning about applying a menthol product to the skin and placing a heating pad over it.The heat increases absorption through the skin. In one case, putting a heating pad on a menthol rub resulted in tissue death.</p>

	<p>Some nasal inhalers contain menthol. The menthol makes us feel as though we are breathing easier, but it does not actually help with congestion. In fact, it appears that more inflammation develops.</p>

	<p>Lastly, some researchers think that cigarettes with menthol might increase the risk of becoming addicted to smoking and might be more toxic than regular cigarettes. Nicotine replacement products used to stop smoking work for menthol cigarette smokers as well. </p>
